Kerala flood analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on understanding the rainfall patterns that contributed to the Kerala Floods of 2018. Using historical rainfall data and visualization tools, this analysis provides insights into the magnitude and distribution of rainfall during the flood period.
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of the 2018 Kerala Flood, one of the most devastating natural disasters in India in recent years. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
ðŸ“˜ Overview
